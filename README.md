# Top Earner Challenge
#### Author: Heitor Kunrath

## Overview
This repository hosts two versions of a Node.js application designed to address a specific programming challenge. The challenge involves making an HTTP GET request to an API, processing the retrieved data, and subsequently making a POST request with specific data derived from the initial GET request.

- The more elaborate and recent version made with TS is available on the `main` branch and also on the `V2` branch.
- A simpler, initial version of the solution using JS can be found on the `V1` branch.



### Requirements
- The candidate should not use frameworks like React, Angular, and Express, or bootstraps like create-react-app and angular cli. Libraries are allowed, just not frameworks.
- A reviewer should be able to clone this repository (e.g., from GitHub, Bitbucket).
- A reviewer should be able to run `npm install` and get all required dependencies.
- A reviewer should be able to run `npm start` to run the application.
- A reviewer should be able to see that calls are successful.
- The work should be free of CORS errors when running on `http://localhost`.
- Code is commented where appropriate.
